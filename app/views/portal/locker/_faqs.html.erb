		<li><strong>What is the balloting algorithm like?</strong></li>
		<p>
			First we write each application on a slip of paper. Then we throw the slips of paper all in a large fish bowl and mix 
			it good. Next we just pick a slip at random and assign the applicant a locker based on the his/her list of preferences. 
			We then discard the slip and repeat the previous step until there are no more slips in the fish bowl.
			<br />
			Well of course this is not exactly how we do it but the idea is the same. :)

		<li><strong>Why can't I ballot for Location H?</strong></li>
		<p>
			Location H is reserved for the Computing Club Management Committee members and is not open for balloting.
