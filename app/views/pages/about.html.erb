		<p>The NUS Studentsâ€™ Computing Club represents undergraduates in NUS School of Computing. 
			Our mission is to provide support for our undergraduates during their stay in NUS School 
			of Computing. This is achieved by taking strides in efforts to enhance their welfare, 
			provide leadership opportunities and provide liaising opportunities between the IT industry and them.</p>
	
		<p>Many key activities are carried out throughout the year. The Freshmen Orientation Project 
			is the most important project undertaken by each Management Committee. Its purpose is to 
			welcome and initiate freshmen into our School. </p>

		<p>The Club has also been very pro-active in going beyond its boundaries. We continue to 
			successfully organize flagship events such as Cyber-Gaming Festival, a national electronic 
			gaming competition, and PoolFest, a recreational activity for all NUS Students.</p>

		<p>The Club continues to strive for excellence every single year. With the support of the 
			School of Computing, the undergraduate population, to whom we serve and close links with 
			the industry, we are confident of carrying out our mission.</p>
